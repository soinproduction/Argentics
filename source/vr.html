                  Being a person with a wealth of experience in game art, art lead directs his/her colleagues from the very first steps of the project. A lead conveys the art mood style, message etc. Also, this person makes sure that each and every team member involved in the project is on the same page with the Client’s vision on a regular basis.

              </h3>
              <p class="list-sec__text">
                Project managers act as the major point of contact. They translate Client’s vision on many important points, like 2D game art, to the rest of the teammates and ensure that the game art team runs like clockwork. Project Managers effectively lead large art groups by keeping every member in line with the final goals. The role is responsible for planning and observing game project deadlines, managing artists and other people involved in game development.

                2D art veterans can know how to do the job in the most time-effective manner. They do the heavy lifting for the entire 2D art team by taking on the most challenging tasks. Their experience is invaluable to less seasoned colleagues who handle less challenging tasks. Normally senior artists are well-rounded experts that are familiar with all the 2D art elements like concept art, UI/UX, 2D characters and environment.

              <p class="list-sec__text">
                There are different directions in 2D art. So normally creating an environment art and designing a character require different mindsets. We have a crew of expert-level artists who specialize in particular aspects of design: from making joyful and memorable 2D characters to drawing grim landscapes or designing crisp game cards.
